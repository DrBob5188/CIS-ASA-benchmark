# CIS-ASA-benchmark
A Pester unit testing framework for offline assessment of an ASA configuration against CIS Cisco ASA 9.x Firewall Benchmark v1.0.0 - 04-30-2021

Still a work in progress but does significantly more than Tenables Nessus offline assessment for this benchmark.
Documentation is still a todo but there are comments in the Get-AsaConfigAudit.tests.ps1 file that provide example guidance on how to invoke the test.
